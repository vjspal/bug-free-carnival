# Connecting local repository to GitHub (2025-11-07 14:08Z)

I think you're asking how to create a **pull request (PR)** to connect your GitHub repo with your local one and sync changes between them.

Let me clarify the typical workflow:

**If you want to sync changes from local to GitHub:**
1. **Stage your changes**: `git add .`
2. **Commit**: `git commit -m "Your message"`
3. **Push to GitHub**: `git push origin branch-name`
4. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub (if working on a branch other than main)

**If you want to set up the connection for the first time:**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

However, I'd like to understand your situation better:

1. **Do you already have a GitHub repository set up?** If so, do you have the repo URL?
2. **Is this workspace already a git repository?** (Can you check if a `` folder exists?)
3. **What branch are you currently on?** (Run `git branch` to see)
4. **What are you trying to achieve** - push existing code to GitHub, or pull code from GitHub?

Could you provide more details about what you're working with in ``? I can then give you the exact steps needed.

i added origin but there is existing code at each @

I can see the issue! You're getting an error because the remote origin already exists with different code. The error message shows:

```
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/vijspal/homlab.automation.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally
```

This means there's existing code on GitHub that isn't in your local repository. You need to **pull first** before pushing.

Here's what to do:

1. **Fetch and merge the remote changes:**
```bash
git pull origin main
```

This will bring the existing code from GitHub into your local repository and merge it with your local changes.

2. **If there are conflicts**, git will tell you which files have conflicts. You'll need to:
   - Open those files
   - Resolve the conflicts manually (choose which version to keep)
   - Stage the resolved files: `git add .`
   - Commit: `git commit -m "Merge remote changes"`

3. **Then push your changes:**
```bash
git push origin main
```

**Or, if you want to overwrite the remote with your local code** (careful - this deletes remote changes):
```bash
git push -f origin main
```

Which would you prefer - merging the remote code with your local code, or replacing it entirely?
